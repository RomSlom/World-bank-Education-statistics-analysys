# World-bank-Education-statistics-analysys
Goal : Determine who will be the best countries to deploy an offer on online educational training
This project is the second one of the OpenclassRooms Data Scientist training. 

World Bank data are available at the following address: 
https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/education-statistics

We can have a look at the home page, which describes the dataset. In a nutshell, the World Bank's "EdStats All Indicator Query" lists 4000 international indicators describing access to education, graduation and information on teachers, education spending... more info are available on this page:

For pre-analysis, we will:

Validate the quality of this dataset (does it contain a lot of missing or duplicated data?)
Describe the information contained in the dataset (number of columns? number of rows?)
Select the information that seems relevant to the problem (which columns contain information that could be useful in answering the company's problem?).
Determine the orders of magnitude of classic statistical indicators for the world's different geographical zones and countries (average/median/standard deviation by country and by continent or geographical block).
This work enables us to determine whether this dataset can inform decisions to open up to new countries.
