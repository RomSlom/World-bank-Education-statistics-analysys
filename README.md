World Bank data are available at the following address

Or as a direct download at this link.

I'll let you have a look at the home page, which describes the dataset. In a nutshell, the World Bank's "EdStats All Indicator Query" lists 4000 international indicators describing access to education, graduation and information on teachers, education spending... You'll find more info on this site:

For pre-analysis, could you :

Validate the quality of this dataset (does it contain a lot of missing or duplicated data?)
Describe the information contained in the dataset (number of columns? number of rows?)
Select the information that seems relevant to the problem (which columns contain information that could be useful in answering the company's problem?).
Determine the orders of magnitude of classic statistical indicators for the world's different geographical zones and countries (average/median/standard deviation by country and by continent or geographical block).
Your work will enable us to determine whether this dataset can inform decisions to open up to new countries. We're going to share your analysis with the board, so please present it carefully and illustrate it with graphics.
